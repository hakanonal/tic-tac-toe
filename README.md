# Tic-Tac-Toe

I have inspired this project from a conference called [IstanbulTechWeek](https://www.istanbultechweek.com) that has been held on-line in the begining of 2020 November. In the first day of this confenrence there was a very simple [explanation](https://youtu.be/aV7-4iKWOuw) of how to implement a reinforcement q-learning algorithm that implements tic-tac-toe. The presentation was made succesfully by [Joe Fitzgerald](https://www.linkedin.com/in/js-fitz/). I would like to thank him here for his contributions. I just wanted to bring my own solution here to see how I could quick do that.
